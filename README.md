## Description
This project was created to assist managers or project leads to create a visual representation of their team. Once they start the program then they will be presented with prompts about information of the manager of their team. Once they have filled all of that out they will be presented with an option to add an engineer or an intern or that they are finished building their team. The user can add as many team members as they would like. 

## Installation Instructions
Open the Command Prompt and change your directory to the top level of this application. Once at that directory, run 'npm init -y.' Once this is completed you will need to run 'npm i'. Once this is done you should be good to go.
